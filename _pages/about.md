Welcome
======
Hello!  I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Northwestern University, where I am also a Graduate Fellow at the Center for Legal Studies.  I previously earned a B.A. from Pomona College, a J.D. from Cornell Law School, and an M.A. from Northwestern University.  

My past work has appeared in the _Cornell Law Review_ and _International Affairs_.  My current research focuses on issues at the intersection of law and politics in the areas of intellectual property, immigration, human rights, and judicial nominations in the United States and in a cross-national context.
