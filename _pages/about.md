Welcome
======
Hello!  I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Northwestern University, where I am also a Graduate Fellow at the Center for Legal Studies and a Graduate Affiliate at the Buffett Institute for Global Studies.  I previously earned a B.A. from Pomona College, a J.D. from Cornell Law School, and an M.A. from Northwestern University.  My current research uses machine learning and quantitative causal inference methods to conduct empirical legal studies in the areas of immigration, intellectual property, and human rights.
