Welcome
======
Hello!  I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Northwestern University, where I am also a Graduate Fellow at the Center for Legal Studies and a Graduate Affiliate at the Buffett Institute for Global Studies.  I previously earned a B.A. from Pomona College, a J.D. from Cornell Law School, and an M.A. from Northwestern University.  My research interests lie at the intersection of law and political economy, particularly in the areas of intellectual property and international monetary lending.
