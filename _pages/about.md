Welcome
======
Hello!  I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at Northwestern University, where I am also a Graduate Fellow at the Center for Legal Studies.  I previously earned a B.A. from Pomona College, a J.D. from Cornell Law School, and an M.A. from Northwestern University.  My dissertation research focuses on the law and politics surrounding the protection of confidential business information.
